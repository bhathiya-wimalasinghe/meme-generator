Meme Generator

This is a simple meme generator project that I did to practice React. In this app, we get urls of random images by calling an API, which is provided by scrimba.com. We can change the image and add text to the top and bottom parts of the image. In this way, we can add simple text to the top and bottom of the image and create a simple meme.

While doing this project, I was able to get a good understanding of important features of React like props, state, useState(), useEffect(), etc. This project was done while following the "Learn React" course offered by scrimba.com. This course guided me through this whole project, and it is very easy to learn with their new video format for code screencasts called "scrims.".
